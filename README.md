# Music via algorithm

- input corpus of midi files
- extra melodies, chords progressions, rhythms, and song structure
- generate markov chains (research into maximizing Dimentionality still in process) for each
- output song using probabilties from previous step, along with user parameters

Note: I'll add more to this description once I've made more progress.
