To begin:

1. Folder named "input" should include one or more midi files.
2. Run the script named "main.py". It calls the rest of the functions.
3. Upon successful execution, folder named "output" should contain an .mp3 of the finished song.

Advanced:

If you want some options, first try changing the parameters documented in main.py
Also, the structure of that file should give you an idea of what the inputs and output of each function are. If you want to know more that what it listed in main.py, dig into the rest of the files.

Let me know if you have any questions or find any bugs. Thanks!
